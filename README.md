im wanting to find experienced programers, hackers on github or anywhere else that will work with mr creating projects that will do all of the things that i need to have done so please message me on here with any advice because im flying solo here working with github and ive never used github before so i would very much love it if some of you experieced programers and hackers will help me create my projects on here and show me how to make them work. Im majoring in computer science , Cybersecurity and A.I. Im not sure how to do anything yet on github but im thinking that I can create sone type of repository on here and ask for help doing it. I also thought I saw on here somewhere where i can join groups that are already established to ask for help so if you can tell me how to join any groups on here lke a beginners group or how to start my first repository, Id reaaly appreaciate it. If i need to create a different email using something other then gmail thats moew secure and safe for us to talk through then please tell me how to do that also. thank you
